I have migrated the automated Russian subtitling and translation system entirely from Parakeet (multilingual) to GigaAM (Russian only).

Word precision has improved substantially.

However, GigaAM does not seem to have been trained on songs and still struggles with overlapping music and voice, overlapping voices and polyphony.
